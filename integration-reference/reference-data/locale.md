description: Supported locale values by airline for request fields such as FR order locale.

# Locale Reference

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this page when an airline requires a supported locale value in the request.

### What this page covers

This page lists supported locale values by airline.

Use these values in request fields such as `locale` when the airline flow requires them.

### When locale matters

Locale is most relevant when:

* the airline requires a market-specific language or country code
* the booking flow displays airline-hosted confirmation or checkout content
* FR-specific order flows require a locale value

### Where to use it

Use locale with:

* [Create Order](../../integration-guides/booking-overview/create-order.md)
* [FR Integration](../../integration-guides/special-integrations/fr-integration.md)
