# Void

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this section when the order may still qualify for void.

Start here when you need to:

* decide whether the case should use **Void** or **Refund**
* follow the standard void sequence
* confirm which identifiers to keep for follow-up

### FAQ

#### What is the standard Atlas API void flow?

The standard flow is `voidQuotation.do` → `void.do` → `queryVoidOrders.do`.

Request quotation first.

Then submit the void with the latest `voidOfferId`.

After submission, query status with `voidCode` until the case is closed.

#### When can a void request fail before submission?

Void can fail when the order is already outside the void window, the `orderNo` is wrong, or the quotation is no longer current.

Check current order state and request a fresh quotation first.

#### Does Atlas support partial-pax void?

No.

Atlas accepts full-order void only.

Do not plan a split-order or split-PNR workaround for Atlas void.

#### When should I use Void?

Use **Void** when the order is still inside the airline void window.

Start with quotation before submission.

#### When should I use Refund instead?

Use **Refunds** when the void window has passed or the case no longer qualifies for the dedicated void path.

Do not keep retrying void after the window closes.

### Typical flow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Check void eligibility

Call `voidQuotation.do` first.

Confirm the order is still voidable.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Submit the void

Use the latest `voidOfferId` from the quotation response.

Keep the returned `voidCode`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Query final status

Use `queryVoidOrders.do` until the case is completed, rejected, or otherwise closed.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### What should you confirm before submission?

Confirm:

* the original `orderNo` is correct
* the order is still inside the void window
* the returned same-day deadline has not passed yet
* the latest `voidOfferId` is used
* the case should not move to the refund flow instead
* the request covers the full order, not only some passengers

### Which identifiers matter?

Keep these values through the flow:

* `orderNo` for quotation
* `voidOfferId` for submission
* `voidCode` for status follow-up

Use the latest quotation result before submission.

Do not reuse an older `voidOfferId`.

Treat the returned deadline as strict.

After it passes, `void.do` is rejected immediately.

### What this page does not cover

This page does not list full endpoint schemas or field-level definitions.

Use the API reference for request and response details.

### What comes next?

Open the endpoint page below for request and response details.

Then reconcile the outcome with the current order state.
