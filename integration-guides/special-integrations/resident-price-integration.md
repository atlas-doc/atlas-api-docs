# Resident Price Integration

Use this page when you need resident fare support for eligible Spain domestic bookings.

### When to use this flow

Use the resident fare flow only when:

* the passenger is eligible for Spain resident or family discount programs
* the route is a supported Spain domestic route
* you can collect the required proof fields during booking
* the airline supports resident fare handling

### Supported airlines

* `FR`
* `VY`

### Eligible passenger groups

This flow applies to legal residents of:

* Canary Islands
* Balearic Islands
* Ceuta
* Melilla

Residency proof is required, such as `DNI` or `NIE`, depending on the fare type.

### Eligible routes

Only domestic Spain routes are eligible, and the itinerary must match the resident program rules.

| Resident region  | Allowed route range                                        | Example     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Canary Islands   | Any airport in Spain ↔ any airport in the Canary Islands   | `MAD → TFS` |
| Balearic Islands | Any airport in Spain ↔ any airport in the Balearic Islands | `VLC → PMI` |

### What the discount applies to

Resident pricing can apply to:

* base fare
* first baggage piece per passenger per segment
* infant fee
* mandatory seat selection fee

Government taxes and fees are **not** discounted.

### Final verification behavior

Atlas passes resident fare details to the airline during fulfillment.

The airline verifies eligibility after ticketing.\
If verification fails:

* the booking is not automatically canceled
* the traveler may be asked to present proof at the airport

Make sure travelers are prepared with the required original documents.
