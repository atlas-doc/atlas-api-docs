# Production Go-Live

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this page when you are ready to move from sandbox to production.

Start here when you need to:

* switch from sandbox to production safely
* understand what changes at go-live
* monitor the first live orders and webhook events

### FAQ

#### When can we generate production credentials?

Only after UAT passes and your customer manager switches the account to `LIVE`.

UAT approval alone does not unlock production credentials.

#### What should we monitor right after go-live?

Monitor first live orders, payment results, ticketing follow-up, and webhook delivery closely.

Use a controlled smoke test before normal production traffic ramps up.

### Goal of this phase

Move the integration from sandbox to production.

This is the final step in the overall onboarding flow.

### When to start

Start this step after:

* the required UAT work is complete
* your booking flow is stable
* webhook handling is ready
* your team can monitor the first live orders

Do not start production setup before your go-live checklist is ready.

You can generate production credentials only after UAT passes and your customer manager switches your account to `LIVE` status.

### What should be ready before go-live?

Make sure UAT is approved, the booking flow is stable, webhook handling is ready, and the team can monitor live transactions from the first order.

### What changes in production

Move these items from sandbox to production:

* credentials
* endpoints
* payment handling
* operational monitoring

Header rules stay the same.

Live bookings and payments are real transactions.

In production, get the live API base URLs in ATRIP under `My Profile` → `Company Information`.

Do not reuse the sandbox base URL after go-live.

Production uses one base URL for `search` and another for all other transaction APIs.

### Best practice

Switch credentials and endpoints in a controlled release.

Validate the first live flow end to end before scaling traffic.

### Go-live checklist

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Confirm UAT completion

Make sure the required UAT work is complete and any remaining issues are closed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Wait for LIVE status

After UAT passes, your customer manager changes your account status to `LIVE`.

You cannot generate production credentials before this status update is complete.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Generate production credentials

After your account is in `LIVE` status, generate the production client ID and client secret in ATRIP.

Set up your IP whitelist in the same production setup flow.

Customers can generate these values directly only after the account is set to `LIVE`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Switch your environment

Replace sandbox credentials and sandbox endpoints in your server configuration.

Get the live API base URLs from ATRIP under `My Profile` → `Company Information`.

Use the production `search` base URL for search traffic.

Use the other production base URL for all remaining transaction APIs.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Run a controlled smoke test

Verify the first live API calls, webhook delivery, and ticketing follow-up.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Monitor the first live orders

Track order status, payment results, and webhook events closely after launch.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Complete this phase when

You have all of these in production:

* working production credentials
* account status updated to `LIVE`
* correct production endpoints
* successful smoke test results
* monitored first live orders and webhooks

### Output of this phase

* production-ready environment
* live booking capability
* initial post-launch validation completed

### Important notes

* Do not use sandbox cards in production.
* Do not use sandbox fares for production checks.
* Keep production credentials server-side.
* Confirm that your production IP whitelist stays up to date.
* UAT completion alone does not unlock production credentials. Your customer manager must switch the account to `LIVE`.

### What comes next?

After the first live smoke test succeeds, keep monitoring early production traffic until order status, payment handling, and webhook behavior are stable.
