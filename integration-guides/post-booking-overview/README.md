# Post-booking Overview

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this section after the booking flow is complete.

Start here when you need to:

* choose the right post-booking workflow
* decide whether the case is a refund, void, ancillary, maintenance, or PNR issue
* route operational follow-up after ticketing

### FAQ

#### What should I use after the booking flow is complete?

Use this section for refunds, voids, post-ticketing ancillaries, order maintenance, and PNR claim workflows.

Start by checking the current order state before taking post-booking action.

#### Which post-booking path should I choose?

Use **Refunds** for refund quotation, submission, and status tracking.

Use [**Void**](../../readme/post-booking-overview/post-booking-operations/void.md) when the order is still inside the airline void window and should follow the dedicated void flow.

Use **Post-ticketing Ancillaries** for baggage or seat actions after ticketing.

Use **Order Maintenance** and **PNR Claim & Extraction** when the booking needs operational follow-up or intervention.
