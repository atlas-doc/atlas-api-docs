# Search

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this page to start the booking flow.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`Smart Search` (`smartSearch.do`) will be deprecated soon.

Do not use it for new integrations. Prefer the standard `search.do` flow.
{% endhint %}

Start here when you need to:

* begin the standard booking flow
* choose between `search.do` and `getOffers.do`
* understand which identifier to keep for the next step

### FAQ

#### When should I use `search.do`?

Use `search.do` when Atlas is your main shopping entry point.

Keep the returned `routingIdentifier` for `verify.do`.

#### When should I use `getOffers.do` instead?

Use `getOffers.do` when you already know the target itinerary or need an independent price check.

Keep the returned `OfferId` for the order flow.

### What this page covers

* Standard offer search
* Independent Get Offer lookup
* Advanced or smart search flows
* Offer polling and request follow-up

### Main APIs

* `search.do`
* `getOffers.do`
* `smartSearch.do`

### Key outputs

* `routingIdentifier` for standard verify flow
* `OfferId` for Get Offer order flow
* `requestId` for smart search follow-up
* Offer data for downstream selection

### Which identifier should you keep?

Keep the identifier that matches the flow:

* `routingIdentifier` for the standard search → verify flow
* `OfferId` for the Get Offer → order flow
* `requestId` only for smart search follow-up

Do not mix identifiers across flows.

### Use this when you need

* A standard search-to-book flow
* An independent offer lookup without standard search
* Smart or asynchronous search behavior
* Offer refresh after smart search

### What comes next?

#### Standard flow

Call [Verify](verify.md) with `routingIdentifier`.

#### Get Offer flow

Continue with [Get Offer](get-offer.md) and then create the order with `OfferId`.

#### Smart search flow

Use the smart search follow-up only for existing implementations.
