# Incident Notification

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this webhook when Atlas detects an operational incident affecting an order.

### Trigger

Atlas sends an incident notification for:

* `email.schedulechange`
* `order.schedulechange`
* `abnormal.cancelled`

### What you should do

When you receive this event:

* identify the incident type
* decide whether traveler action is needed
* notify affected customers if required
* use incident query or order query for follow-up investigation

### Endpoint

POST to the webhook URL you registered with Atlas.

### Fields to read first

* `type`
* `notificationId`
* `status`
* `data.orderNo`

Then read incident-specific fields based on `type`.

### Incident types

#### `email.schedulechange`

Atlas received an airline schedule-change email.\
Use `data.emailSubject` and `data.emailLink`.

#### `order.schedulechange`

Atlas has structured schedule change data.\
Use segment arrays and `scheduleChangeType`.

#### `abnormal.cancelled`

An unexpected cancellation was detected.\
Use the order number and cancellation details for follow-up.

### Notes

* `status` is incident confirmation state
* `emailLink` is temporary and should be stored quickly if needed
* register your webhook URL before relying on these events
