# Incident Query

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/eva-help-hint.md" %}

Use this page to search incident records when webhook delivery or event state needs confirmation.

Start here when you need to:

* reconcile missed or unclear webhook events
* search incidents by order, airline, passenger, or time range
* investigate schedule-change or cancellation history

### FAQ

#### When should I use Incident Query?

Use Incident Query when webhook delivery, incident history, or event confirmation still needs deeper reconciliation.

#### Which filters should I start with?

Start with `orderNo` for one affected booking.

Add `eventType`, airline, or time range filters when the incident set is broader.
