#### Which payment methods does Atlas support?

The main options are **deposit** and **VCC pass-through**.

Supported options still depend on airline and ticketing channel.

### Which payment methods does Atlas support?

The main options are:

* **Deposit**
* **VCC pass-through**

Supported options still depend on airline and ticketing channel.

#### How does VCC pass-through work?

Send card details in the `pay.do` request.

Atlas passes the card data to the airline, the airline charges you directly, and Atlas deducts the technical service fee from your Atlas account.

### How does VCC pass-through work?

Send card details in the `pay.do` request.\
Atlas passes the card data to the airline.\
The airline charges you directly.\
Atlas then deducts the technical service fee from your Atlas account.

Check payment support in the search or verification response before you build the payment flow.

#### Does Atlas issue VCC cards?

No.

Atlas supports VCC pass-through only.

You provide the card details in `pay.do`.

### Does Atlas issue VCC cards?

No.\
Atlas supports VCC pass-through only.

You provide the card details in `pay.do`.

#### Where do refunds go for each payment mode?

For **VCC**, refunded funds usually return to the original card.

For **deposit**, Atlas credits your balance after airline funds are received.

### Where do refunds go for each payment mode?

For **VCC**, refunded funds usually return to the original card.\
For **deposit**, Atlas credits your balance after airline funds are received.

#### When should we use deposit instead of VCC?

Use deposit when you want a simpler payment path or when VCC is not supported for the airline, order, or mixed-channel itinerary.

Deposit is also the fallback path in some payment-risk or split-payment scenarios.

### Why is VCC pass-through unavailable on some mixed-airline bookings?

Atlas does not support multiple VCCs in one `pay.do` request.

When outbound and inbound segments require different ticketing channels, two separate payments may be needed.\
If Atlas cannot support that split in one payment flow, the payment mode falls back to **deposit**.

### When is cardholder address data required?

Some airlines require full billing address details.\
Use the matrix below when you send VCC or card-based payments.

Cardholder country, province, city, postcode and address are required only for a select few airlines as per the table provided below:
